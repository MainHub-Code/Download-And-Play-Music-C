# Download-And-Play-Music-C

First: To run the code you have to make folder in ~/ could MyTasks. And make sure that you have download mpv in termux. (IT IS ONLY FOR TERMUX)
than run the code by ./Download-And-Play-Music-C

In this C program I just make something to learn C language and how to use git with github and push files / folders. This C code is to play music that i have push them in Library/Music only. It check's if the Library is available if it is not available than you have to download the Library or you can make a folder could Library/Music/ and then make all the songs that you what and check for the name rename them to my Library musics name.
